       Many putative downstream effectors of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac contain a GTPase binding domain (GBD), also called p21 binding domain (PBD), which has been shown to specifically bind the GTP bound form of Cdc42 or Rac, with a preference for Cdc42 [
      , 
      ]. The most conserved region of GBD/PBD domains is the N-terminal Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif (CRIB), which consists of about 16 amino acids with the consensus sequence I-S-x-P-x(2,4)-F-x-H-x(2)-H-V-G [

guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, and the inactive state by GTPase-activating proteins

      Actin [

These filaments interact with myosin to produce a sliding effect, which is the basis of muscular contraction and many aspects of cell motility, including cytokinesis. Each actin protomer binds one molecule of ATP and has one high affinity site for either calcium or magnesium ions, as well as several low affinity sites. Actin exists as a monomer in low salt concentrations, but filaments form rapidly as salt concentration rises, with the consequent hydrolysis of ATP. Actin from many sources forms a tight complex with deoxyribonuclease (DNase I) although the significance of this is still unknown. The formation of this complex results in the inhibition of DNase I activity, and actin loses its ability to polymerise. It has been shown that an ATPase domain of actin shares similarity with ATPase domains of hexokinase and hsp70

These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([intenz:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [
      ]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.

  <name>Rho GTPase activation protein</name>
    <p>
       Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs  that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains [
      ].

  <name>Histone-fold</name>
    <p>
       Histones mediate DNA organisation and plays a dominant role in regulating eukaryotic transcription. The histone-fold consists of a core of three helices, where the long middle helix is flanked at each end by shorter ones. The histone fold is a structural element that facilitates heterodimerisation [
      , 
      , 
      ]. Proteins displaying this structure include the nucleosome core histones, which form octomers composed of two copies of each of the four histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4; archaeal histone, which possesses only the core domain part of eukaryotic histone; and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAF), where the histone fold is a common motif for mediating TAF-TAF interactions. TAF proteins include TAF(II)18 and TAF(II)28, which form a heterodimer, TAF(II)42 and TAF(II)62, which form a heterotetramer similar to (H3-H4)2, and the negative cofactor 2 (NC2) alpha and beta chains, which form a heterodimer. The TAF proteins are a component of transcription factor IID (TFIID), along with the TBP protein. TFIID forms part of the pre-initiation complex on core promoter elements required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. The TAF subunits of TFIID mediate transcriptional activation of subsets of eukaryotic genes. The NC2 complex mediates the inhibition of TATA-dependent transcription through interactions with TBP.

      The stability of beta-tubulin mRNAs are autoregulated by their own translation product [
      ]. Unpolymerised tubulin subunits bind directly (or activate a factor(s) which binds co-translationally) to the nascent N terminus of beta-tubulin. This binding is transduced through the adjacent ribosomes to activate an RNAse that degrades the polysome-bound mRNA. The recognition element has been shown to be the first four amino acids of beta-tubulin: Met-Arg-Glu-Ile. Mutations to this sequence abolish the autoregulation effect (except for the replacement of Glu by Asp); transposition of this sequence to an internal region of a polypeptide also suppresses the autoregulatory effect.

      Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that play an active role in controlling nuclear cell division cycles [
      ], and regulate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins, together with the p34 (cdc2) or cdk2 kinases, form the Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). There are two main groups of cyclins, G1/S cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S (start) transition, and G2/M cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M (mitosis) transition. G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase). In most species, there are multiple forms of G1 and G2 cyclins. For example, in vertebrates, there are two G2 cyclins, A and B, and at least three G1 cyclins, C, D, and E.

      Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) catalyses conversion of the linear tripeptide delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) to isopenicillin N (IPN), the central step in biosynthesis of the beta-lactam antibiotics [
      ]. IPNS is a nonhaem-Fe2+-dependent enzyme. It belongs to a class of nonhaem Fe2+-containing enzymes which includes 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxy- lases, and enzymes involved in ethylene formation and anthocyaninidin biosynthesis.

  <name>Kinesin-like protein</name>
    <p>
      Kinesin [
      , 
      , 
      ] is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that play a role in organelle transport. The kinesin motor activity is directed toward the microtubule's plus end. Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The maintenance of the quaternary structure does not require interchain disulphide bonds.

  <name>Harbinger transposase-derived nuclease domain</name>
    <p>
      This domain is found in proteins that are related to  
       and are probably endonucleases of the DDE superfamily. Proteins containing this domain include the putative nuclease HARBI1. HARBI1 is a transposase-derived protein that may have nuclease activity potential. It does not have transposase activity [

  <name>Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases</name>
    <p>
      The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([intenz:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [
      ]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.

      This superfamily represents a domain found in phosphotransferases that have an alcohol group as an acceptor ([intenz:2.7.1.-]). However, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate kinase (HMPP kinase) catalyses two phosphorylation reactions: one to a hydroxymethyl group of hydroxymethyl pyrimidine (HMP) and the second to the phosphomethyl group of HMPP [
      ]. The common structural feature for the enzymes in this superfamily is a central eight-stranded sheet that is flanked by eight structurally conserved helices, five on one side and three on the other [
      ]. The active site is located in a shallow groove along one edge of the sheet, with the phosphate acceptor hydroxyl group and -phosphate of ATP close together in the middle of the groove, and substrate and ATP binding at the ends [
      ].

  <name>Xylan O-acetyltransferase 1</name>
    <p>
      Trichome birefringence-like (TBL) proteins are proposed to encode wall poly-
saccharide specific O-acetyltransferases. This entry represents protein trichome birefringence-like 29 (TBL29), also known as XOAT1 or ESKIMO 1 (ESK1). In Arabidopsis, XOAT1 catalyzes the 2-O-acetylation of xylan, followed by nonenzymatic acetyl migration to the O-3 position, resulting in products that are monoacetylated at both O-2 and O-3 positions [
      , 
      ]. Its role is essential for the production of functional xylem vessels [

  <name>Histone H2A, C-terminal domain</name>
    <p>
      Histone H2A is a small, highly conserved nuclear protein that, together with two molecules each of histones H2B, H3 and H4, forms the eukaryotic nucleosome core [
      ]; the nucleosome octamer winds ~146 DNA base-pairs.  In the mouse, histone H2A can be replaced by histone H2A-like 1 [
      ].

      This superfamily represents a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), right-handed beta-alpha superhelix domain, such as that found in bacterial invasion protein internalin [
      ] or in the L domain from members of the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) family [
      ].
