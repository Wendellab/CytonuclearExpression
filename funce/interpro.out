C2 domains are unique among membrane targeting domains in that they show wide range of lipid selectivity for the major components of cell membranes, including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. This C2 domain is about  116 amino-acid residues and is located between the two copies of the C1 domain in Protein Kinase C and the protein kinase catalytic  domain [

      The alpha/beta hydrolase fold [

All have a catalytic triad, the elements of which are borne on loops, which are the best conserved structural features of the fold.

      This entry represents B-box-type zinc finger domains, which are around 40 residues in length.  B-box zinc fingers can be divided into two groups, where types 1 and 2 B-box domains differ in their consensus sequence and in the spacing of the 7-8 zinc-binding residues. Several proteins contain both types 1 and 2 B-boxes, suggesting some level of cooperativity between these two domains. B-box domains are found in over 1500 proteins from a variety of organisms. They are found in TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins that consist of an N-terminal RING finger (originally called an A-box), followed by 1-2 B-box domains and a coiled-coil domain (also called RBCC for Ring, B-box, Coiled-Coil). TRIM proteins contain a type 2 B-box domain, and may also contain a type 1 B-box. In proteins that do not contain RING or coiled-coil domains, the B-box domain is primarily type 2. Many type 2 B-box proteins are involved in ubiquitination. Proteins containing a B-box zinc finger domain include transcription factors, ribonucleoproteins and proto-oncoproteins; for example, MID1, MID2, TRIM9, TNL, TRIM36, TRIM63, TRIFIC, NCL1 and CONSTANS-like proteins [

  <name>Ribosomal protein L33</name>

      Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [
      , 
      ].  About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.

      DSBA is a sub-family of the Thioredoxin family [
      ]. The efficient and correct folding of bacterial disulphide bonded proteins 
      <i>in vivo</i>
       is  dependent upon a class of periplasmic oxidoreductase proteins called DsbA, after the Escherichia coli enzyme.  The bacterial protein-folding factor DsbA is the  most oxidizing of the thioredoxin family. DsbA catalyses disulphide-bond formation during the folding of secreted proteins. The extremely oxidizing nature of DsbA has   been proposed to result from either domain motion or stabilising active-site interactions in the reduced form. DsbA's highly oxidizing nature is a result of hydrogen bond, electrostatic and helix-dipole interactions that favour the thiolate over the disulphide at the active site [
      ]. In the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the DsbA homologue (TcpG) is responsible for the folding, maturation and secretion of virulence factors.

      The HRD4 gene is identical to NPL4, a gene previously implicated in nuclear transport. Using a diverse set of substrates and direct ubiquitination assays, analysis revealed that HRD4/NPL4 is required for a poorly characterised step in ER-associated degradation following ubiquitination of target proteins but preceding their recognition by the 26S proteasome [
      ]. Npl4p physically associates with Cdc48p via Ufd1p to form a Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex. The Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex functions in the recognition of several polyubiquitin-tagged proteins and facilitates their presentation to the 26S proteasome for processive degradation or even more specific processing [

      This entry represents the formiminotransferase (FT) domain of formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD), which forms a homodimer, with each protomer being comprised of two subdomains. Each subdomain has the structure consisting of an alpha/beta sandwich with antiparallel beta-sheet in the form (beta-alpha-beta)x2. Tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent glutamate formiminotransferase is involved in the histidine utilization pathway.  This enzyme interconverts L-glutamate and N-formimino-L-glutamate.  The enzyme is bifunctional as it also catalyzes the cyclodeaminase reaction on N-formimino-THF, converting it to 5,10-methenyl-THF and releasing ammonia; part of the process of regenerating THF. This model covers enzymes from metazoa as well as Gram-positive bacteria and archaea.  In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in a disease phenotype [
      ].  The crystal structure of the enzyme has been studied in the context of the catalytic mechanism [

      Proteins synthesized on the ribosome and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and from there via small carrier vesicles to their final destination compartment. This traffic is bidirectional, to ensure that proteins required to form vesicles are recycled. Vesicles have specific coat proteins (such as clathrin or coatomer) that are important for cargo selection and direction of transfer [

      The  WRKY  domain  is  a 60 amino acid region that is defined by the conserved amino  acid  sequence  WRKYGQK  at  its  N-terminal end, together with a novel zinc-finger-like  motif.  The WRKY domain is found in one or two copies in a superfamily  of  plant  transcription  factors  involved  in the regulation of various  physiological  programs that are unique to plants, including pathogen defence,  senescence,  trichome  development and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.  The  WRKY  domain  binds  specifically to the DNA sequence motif (T)(T)TGAC(C/T), which is known as the W box. The invariant TGAC core of the W box is essential for function and WRKY binding [
      ]. Some proteins known to contain a WRKY domain include Arabidopsis thaliana ZAP1 (Zinc-dependent Activator Protein-1) and  AtWRKY44/TTG2,  a  protein  involved  in  trichome development and anthocyanin pigmentation; and wild oat  ABF1-2,  two  proteins  involved  in the gibberelic acid-induced expression of the alpha-Amy2 gene.

      Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates [

      Methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG, or alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG)) is a base excision-repair protein, catalyzing the first step in base excision repair  by cleaving damaged DNA bases within double-stranded DNA to produce an abasic site. MPG bends DNA by intercalating between the base pairs, causing the damaged base to flip out of the double helix and into the enzyme active site for cleavage. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of the deoxyribose N-glycosidic bond, excising 3-methyladenine and 3-methylguanine from damaged DNA [

    <p>
      The formiminotransferase (FT) domain of formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD) forms a homodimer, with each protomer being comprised of two subdomains. The formiminotransferase domain has an N-terminal subdomain that is made up of a six-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains [

  <name>Tom40</name>
    <p>
      Tom40 forms a channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane with a pore about 1.5 to 2.5 nanometers wide. It functions as a transport channel for unfolded protein chains and forms a complex with Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, and Tom22. The primary receptors Tom20 and Tom70 recruit the unfolded precursor protein from the mitochondrial-import stimulating factor (MSF) or cytosolic Hsc70. The precursor passes through the Tom40 channel and through another channel in the inner membrane, formed by Tim23, to be finally translocated into the mitochondrial matrix. The process depends on a proton motive force across the inner membrane and requires a contact site where the outer and inner membranes come close [
      ]. Tom40 is also involved in inserting outer membrane proteins into the membrane, most likely not via a lateral opening in the pore, but by transfering precursor proteins to an outer membrane sorting and assembly machinery [

  <name>Ribosomal protein L33 superfamily</name>

      Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [
      , 
      ].  About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.
