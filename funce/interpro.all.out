C2 domains are unique among membrane targeting domains in that they show wide range of lipid selectivity for the major components of cell membranes, including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. This C2 domain is about  116 amino-acid residues and is located between the two copies of the C1 domain in Protein Kinase C and the protein kinase catalytic  domain [

      The alpha/beta hydrolase fold [

All have a catalytic triad, the elements of which are borne on loops, which are the best conserved structural features of the fold.

      This entry represents B-box-type zinc finger domains, which are around 40 residues in length.  B-box zinc fingers can be divided into two groups, where types 1 and 2 B-box domains differ in their consensus sequence and in the spacing of the 7-8 zinc-binding residues. Several proteins contain both types 1 and 2 B-boxes, suggesting some level of cooperativity between these two domains. B-box domains are found in over 1500 proteins from a variety of organisms. They are found in TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins that consist of an N-terminal RING finger (originally called an A-box), followed by 1-2 B-box domains and a coiled-coil domain (also called RBCC for Ring, B-box, Coiled-Coil). TRIM proteins contain a type 2 B-box domain, and may also contain a type 1 B-box. In proteins that do not contain RING or coiled-coil domains, the B-box domain is primarily type 2. Many type 2 B-box proteins are involved in ubiquitination. Proteins containing a B-box zinc finger domain include transcription factors, ribonucleoproteins and proto-oncoproteins; for example, MID1, MID2, TRIM9, TNL, TRIM36, TRIM63, TRIFIC, NCL1 and CONSTANS-like proteins [

      Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [
      , 
      ].  About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.

      DSBA is a sub-family of the Thioredoxin family [

       is  dependent upon a class of periplasmic oxidoreductase proteins called DsbA, after the Escherichia coli enzyme.  The bacterial protein-folding factor DsbA is the  most oxidizing of the thioredoxin family. DsbA catalyses disulphide-bond formation during the folding of secreted proteins. The extremely oxidizing nature of DsbA has   been proposed to result from either domain motion or stabilising active-site interactions in the reduced form. DsbA's highly oxidizing nature is a result of hydrogen bond, electrostatic and helix-dipole interactions that favour the thiolate over the disulphide at the active site [

      ]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.

      The HAT (Half A TPR) repeat has a repetitive pattern characterised by three aromatic residues with a conserved spacing. They are structurally and sequentially similar to TPRs (tetratricopeptide repeats), though they lack the highly conserved alanine and glycine residues found in TPRs. The number of HAT repeats found in different proteins varies between 9 and 12. HAT-repeat-containing proteins appear to be components of macromolecular complexes that are required for RNA processing [

The WRKY domain is found in one or two copies in a superfamily  of  plant  transcription  factors  involved  in the regulation of various  physiological  programs that are unique to plants, including pathogen defence,  senescence,  trichome  development and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

    <p>
      Actin [

      ] is a ubiquitous protein involved in the formation of filaments that are major components of the cytoskeleton. These filaments interact with myosin to produce a sliding effect, which is the basis of muscular contraction and many aspects of cell motility, including cytokinesis. Each actin protomer binds one molecule of ATP and has one high affinity site for either calcium or magnesium ions, as well as several low affinity sites. Actin exists as a monomer in low salt concentrations, but filaments form rapidly as salt concentration rises, with the consequent hydrolysis of ATP. Actin from many sources forms a tight complex with deoxyribonuclease (DNase I) although the significance of this is still unknown. The formation of this complex results in the inhibition of DNase I activity, and actin loses its ability to polymerise. It has been shown that an ATPase domain of actin shares similarity with ATPase domains of hexokinase and hsp70

      This domain consists of several eukaryotic suppressor of forked (Suf) like proteins. The Drosophila melanogaster suppressor of forked [Su(f)] protein shares homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA14 protein and the 77kDa subunit of Homo sapiens cleavage stimulation factor, which are proteins involved in mRNA 3' end formation. This suggests a role for Su(f) in mRNA 3' end formation in Drosophila. The su(f) gene produces three transcripts; two of them are polyadenylated at the end of the transcription unit, and one is a truncated transcript, polyadenylated in intron 4. It is thought that su(f) plays a role in the regulation of poly(A) site utilisation and the GU-rich sequence is important for this regulation to occur [

      The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([intenz:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [
      ]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.

    <p>
       Proteins containing a RhoGAP (Rho GTPase Activating Protein) domain usually function to catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Rho, Rac and/or Cdc42, inactivating these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The 53 known human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are the largest known group of Rho GTPase regulators and significantly outnumber the 21 Rho GTPases they presumably regulate. This excess of GAP proteins probably indicates complex regulation of the Rho GTPases and is consistent with the existence of almost as many (48) human Dbl domain-containing Rho GEFs  that act antagonistically to the RhoGAP proteins by activating the Rho GTPases. Phylogenetic analysis offers evidence for frequent domain duplication and for duplication of the entire genes containing these GAP domains [

  <name>Histone-fold</name>
    <p>
       Histones mediate DNA organisation and plays a dominant role in regulating eukaryotic transcription. The histone-fold consists of a core of three helices, where the long middle helix is flanked at each end by shorter ones. The histone fold is a structural element that facilitates heterodimerisation [
      , 
      , 
      ]. Proteins displaying this structure include the nucleosome core histones, which form octomers composed of two copies of each of the four histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4; archaeal histone, which possesses only the core domain part of eukaryotic histone; and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAF), where the histone fold is a common motif for mediating TAF-TAF interactions. TAF proteins include TAF(II)18 and TAF(II)28, which form a heterodimer, TAF(II)42 and TAF(II)62, which form a heterotetramer similar to (H3-H4)2, and the negative cofactor 2 (NC2) alpha and beta chains, which form a heterodimer. The TAF proteins are a component of transcription factor IID (TFIID), along with the TBP protein. TFIID forms part of the pre-initiation complex on core promoter elements required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. The TAF subunits of TFIID mediate transcriptional activation of subsets of eukaryotic genes. The NC2 complex mediates the inhibition of TATA-dependent transcription through interactions with TBP.

G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase). In most species, there are multiple forms of G1 and G2 cyclins. For example, in vertebrates, there are two G2 cyclins, A and B, and at least three G1 cyclins, C, D, and E.

      The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([intenz:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [

      Ferredoxin-NADP+ (oxido)reductase is an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible electron transfer between NADP(H) and electron carrier proteins such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin. Isoforms of these flavoproteins (i.e. having a non-covalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group) are present in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria in which they participate in a wide variety of redox metabolic pathways. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule which lies largely in a large gap betweed the two domains. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase first accepts one electron from reduced ferredoxin to form a flavin semiquinone intermediate.

The formiminotransferase domain has an N-terminal subdomain that is made up of a six-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains [

      Tom40 forms a channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane with a pore about 1.5 to 2.5 nanometers wide. It functions as a transport channel for unfolded protein chains and forms a complex with Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, and Tom22. The primary receptors Tom20 and Tom70 recruit the unfolded precursor protein from the mitochondrial-import stimulating factor (MSF) or cytosolic Hsc70. The precursor passes through the Tom40 channel and through another channel in the inner membrane, formed by Tim23, to be finally translocated into the mitochondrial matrix. The process depends on a proton motive force across the inner membrane and requires a contact site where the outer and inner membranes come close [
      ]. Tom40 is also involved in inserting outer membrane proteins into the membrane, most likely not via a lateral opening in the pore, but by transfering precursor proteins to an outer membrane sorting and assembly machinery [

      Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [
      , 
      ].  About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.
