Cytonuclear expression analyses for 4 polyploid genera: *Arabidopsis*, *Arachis*, *Chenopodium*, and *Gossypium*

Cytonuclear coevolution is a common feature among plants, which coordinates gene expression and protein products between the nucleus and organelles. Consequently, lineage-specific differences may result in incompatibilities between the nucleus and cytoplasm in hybrid taxa. Allopolyploidy is also a common phenomenon in plant evolution. The hybrid nature of allopolyploids may result in cytonuclear incompatibilities, but the massive nuclear redundancy created during polyploidy affords additional avenues for resolving cytonuclear conflict (i.e., cytonuclear accommodation). Here we evaluate expression changes in organelle-targeted nuclear genes for six allopolyploid lineages that represent four genera (i.e., *Arabidopsis*, *Arachis*, *Chenopodium*, and *Gossypium*) and encompass a range in polyploid ages. Because incompatibilities between the nucleus and cytoplasm could potentially result in biases toward the maternal homoeolog and/or maternal expression level, we evaluate patterns of homoeolog usage, expression bias, and expression-level dominance in cytonuclear genes relative to the background of non-cytonuclear expression changes and to the diploid parents. Although we find subsets of cytonuclear genes in most lineages that match our expectations of maternal preference, these observations are not consistent among either allopolyploids or categories of organelle-targeted genes. Our results indicate that cytonuclear expression evolution may be subtle and variable among genera and genes, likely reflecting a diversity of mechanisms to resolve nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities in allopolyploid species.
